## Git Cheat Sheet

This cheat sheet covers basic Git commands for managing your version control.

**Setup:**

* `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
* `git config`: Sets up your user information for commits.
* `git clone [URL]`: Clones an existing Git repository from a remote URL.

**Basic Workflow:**

* `git status`: Shows the current status of your working directory and staging area.
* `git add [file]`: Adds a file to the staging area for the next commit.
* `git diff`: Shows the difference between your working directory and the index (staged changes) or the last commit.
* `git commit -m "<message>"`: Creates a new commit with a descriptive message.
* `git log`: Shows the commit history of the current branch.

**Branching and Merging:**

* `git branch`: Lists all local branches.
* `git branch [branch-name]`: Creates a new branch.
* `git checkout [branch-name]`: Switches to a different branch.
* `git merge [branch-name]`: Merges another branch into the current branch.

**Remote Repositories:**

* `git fetch [remote]`: Downloads the latest changes from a remote repository without merging.
* `git pull [remote] [branch-name]`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository.
* `git push [remote] [branch-name]`: Uploads local commits to a remote repository.

**Additional Commands:**

* `git tag`: Creates, lists, or deletes tags for specific commits.
* `git rm [file]`: Removes a file from the working directory and staging area.
* `git reset`: Discards changes and reverts to a previous state. (Use with caution!)
* `git stash`: Saves your uncommitted changes for later and removes them from the working directory.
